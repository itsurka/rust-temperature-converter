# Temperature Converter from/to Celsius - Fahrenheit

I made this application during study the book - [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html)

## Build and run
```shell
cargo run
```

Example: 

```text
% cargo run
   Compiling fahrenheit_celsius_converter v0.1.0 (/Users/iturca/IdeaProjects/fahrenheit_celsius_converter)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.88s
     Running `target/debug/fahrenheit_celsius_converter`
This is °C <-> °F converter!
What scale would you to convert?
Set 1 for °C and 2 for °F:
1
Set temperature:
30
30°C -> 86.00°F
Continue? [Y/n]
Y
Set 1 for °C and 2 for °F:
2
Set temperature:
75
75°F -> 23.89°C
Continue? [Y/n]
n
Done, exiting.
